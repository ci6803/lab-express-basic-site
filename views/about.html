      <h2>Childhood</h2>
      <article>
        Van Gogh was born into an upper-middle-class family. As a child he was
        serious, quiet and thoughtful. He began drawing at an early age and as a
        young man worked as an art dealer, often traveling, but became depressed
        after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion and spent time
        as a Protestant missionary in southern Belgium. He drifted in ill health
        and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having returned home to
        his parents. His younger brother Theo supported him financially; the two
        kept a long correspondence by letter.

      <h2>Early years</h2>
      <article>
        His early works, mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers,
        contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work.
        In 1886, he moved to Paris where he met members of the avant-garde,
        including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were reacting against the
        Impressionist sensibility. As his work developed he created a new
        approach to still life and landscape. His paintings grew brighter as he
        developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in
        the South of France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject
        matter to include series of olive trees, wheat fields and sunflowers.

      <h2>Late works</h2>
      <article>
        Van Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and though he
        worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical
        health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with
        Gauguin ended after a confrontation between the two when, in a rage, Van
        Gogh severed a part of his own left ear with a razor. After, he spent
        time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at Saint-Rémy. After
        he discharged himself and moved to the Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise
        near Paris, he came under the care of the homeopathic doctor Paul
        Gachet. His depression persisted and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh is
        believed to have shot himself in the chest with a revolver, dying from
        his injuries two days later.

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <article>
        Van Gogh's paintings did not sell during his lifetime, during which he
        was generally considered a madman and a failure, although some
        collectors recognised the value of his work. His fame came only after
        his death, when he evolved in the public imagination into a
        misunderstood genius.[6] His reputation grew in the early 20th century
        as elements of his style came to be incorporated by the Fauves and
        German Expressionists. He attained widespread critical and commercial
        success over the ensuing decades, and is remembered as an important but
        tragic painter whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of
        the tortured artist. Today, Van Gogh's works are among the world's most
        expensive paintings to have ever sold, and his legacy is honoured by a
        museum in his name, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which holds the
        world's largest collection of his paintings and drawings.
