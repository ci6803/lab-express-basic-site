    <h1 class="title">Vincent Van Gogh</h1>

    <p class="text">
      A Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most
      famous and influential figures in Western art history. In a decade, he
      created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of
      which date from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes,
      still lifes, portraits, and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold
      colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed
      to the foundations of modern art. He was not commercially successful and,
      struggling with severe depression and poverty, committed suicide at the
      age of 37.
